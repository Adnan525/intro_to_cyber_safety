# Introduction to Cyber Safety - Assessment 2

## **Scenario 1: Cyber Safety Best Practices for Remote Work**

### **1. Identification of Digital Assets**
- **What to Research**:
  - Identify critical digital assets a small business might rely on, such as customer data (e.g., names, addresses, payment details), financial records (e.g., invoices, payroll), intellectual property (e.g., designs, proprietary software), or communication systems (e.g., email, messaging platforms).
  - Investigate how businesses determine which assets are most important based on their operations.
- **Why They Need Protection**:
  - Explore why these assets are valuable—consider financial impacts (e.g., revenue loss from stolen data), legal consequences (e.g., breaches of privacy laws like GDPR), or reputational damage (e.g., loss of customer trust).
- **Research Tip**: Look at small business case studies or cybersecurity frameworks like those from the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/).

### **2. Securing Devices that Connect to the Internet**
- **Best Practices for Securing Devices**:
  - Research at least three strategies, such as:
    - Using strong, unique passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - Keeping operating systems, software, and apps updated to fix security vulnerabilities.
    - Installing and maintaining antivirus or anti-malware software.
  - Look into why these practices are effective against common threats.
- **Securing Wi-Fi Connections**:
  - Investigate methods like:
    - Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt internet traffic.
    - Setting a strong, unique password for the home router and ensuring firmware is updated.
    - Avoiding public Wi-Fi for work tasks, or using a VPN if unavoidable.
  - Research how unsecured Wi-Fi can expose data and how these solutions mitigate risks.
- **Research Tip**: Check guidelines from the [Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/) under their “Work from Home” resources.

### **3. Identifying Cyber Risks and Vulnerabilities**
- **Major Risks**:
  - Research at least three risks remote workers face, such as:
    - Phishing (e.g., fake emails tricking users into sharing credentials).
    - Malware (e.g., ransomware locking files or stealing data).
    - Unsecured networks (e.g., weak home Wi-Fi exploited by attackers).
  - Explore how these risks exploit remote work setups.
- **Real-World Examples**:
  - Find recent examples (e.g., phishing campaigns during remote work surges in 2020-2021 or ransomware targeting small businesses). Look into how they happened and their consequences.

### **4. Cyber Safety Practices to Protect Digital Information**
- **Best Practices**:
  - Research practices like:
    - Enabling MFA on all work-related accounts.
    - Avoiding opening email attachments or clicking links from unknown sources.
    - Backing up data regularly to a secure, encrypted location (e.g., cloud storage).
  - Investigate how these reduce risk exposure.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access**:
  - Explore strategies such as:
    - Implementing role-based access controls (limiting who can access sensitive data).
    - Using encryption for data in transit (e.g., VPNs) and at rest (e.g., encrypted drives).
  - Research why these methods are effective against breaches.
- **Research Tip**: Refer to the [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight) by ACSC for practical strategies.

## **Scenario 2: Cyber Risks, Recent Incidents, and Mitigation Strategies**

### **1. Identify Major Cyber Risks and Threats**
- **What to Research**:
  - List and describe at least five risks, such as:
    - Ransomware (encrypts data for ransom).
    - Data breaches (unauthorized access to sensitive info).
    - Insider threats (misuse of access by employees).
    - Social engineering (e.g., phishing to trick users).
    - IoT vulnerabilities (e.g., weak security in smart devices).
  - Investigate how each affects businesses, households, or individuals.
- **Why They Pose a Risk**:
  - Explore impacts like financial loss, identity theft, or service disruption.
- **Research Tip**: Use threat overviews from [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/) or [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/).

### **2. Research and Analyze Recent Cyber Safety Incidents**
- **What to Research**:
  - Find at least two incidents from the past two years (e.g., a ransomware attack on a business or a data breach affecting consumers).
  - Detail how they occurred (e.g., exploited software flaws, phishing), their impact (e.g., downtime, stolen data), and responses (e.g., patches, lawsuits).

### **3. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations**
- **What to Research**:
  - Suggest at least three strategies per incident, such as:
    - Employee training on recognizing phishing attempts.
    - Deploying endpoint detection tools to spot malware.
    - Creating an incident response plan for quick recovery.
  - Analyze how these could have prevented or reduced the incident’s impact.
- **Research Tip**: Look at mitigation advice in [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) or ACSC’s resources.

## **Scenario 3: Social Media Security, Privacy, and Guidelines for Young People**

### **1. Comparison of Social Media Security & Privacy Features**
- **What to Research**:
  - Choose two platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and compare:
    - Security features (e.g., two-factor authentication, encryption).
    - Privacy options (e.g., control over post visibility, data sharing settings).
    - Transparency (e.g., clarity on data collection in privacy policies).
  - Investigate strengths and weaknesses of each.
- **Which is Better**:
  - Decide which platform offers better protection and justify with evidence (e.g., stronger 2FA options, clearer privacy controls).
- **Research Tip**: Check official help pages of different social media platforms.

### **2. Recommendations for Protecting Users**
- **What to Research**:
  - Suggest 3-5 strategies, such as:
    - Using strong, unique passwords and enabling 2FA.
    - Avoiding clicking suspicious links to prevent phishing.
    - Reviewing privacy settings regularly to limit data exposure.
  - Explore why these enhance user safety.
- **Research Tip**: Use tips from [Stay Safe Online](https://staysafeonline.org/) by the National Cyber Security Alliance.

### **3. Guidelines for Young People**
- **What to Research**:
  - Develop a guideline covering:
    - Safe sharing (e.g., not posting personal details like addresses).
    - Cyberbullying (e.g., recognizing it, reporting to platforms).
    - Scams (e.g., spotting fake profiles or phishing messages).
  - Investigate age-appropriate online risks and solutions.

## **General Guidelines**
- **Use Reputable Sources**: Research from trusted organizations like CISA, ACSC, NCSC, or cybersecurity firms (e.g., [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/)). Avoid unverified blogs or forums.
- **Provide Working Links**: Include URLs to sources in their work, ensuring they’re functional (e.g., test links before submission).
- **Think Critically**: Focus on practical, real-world applications—e.g., how a small business with limited budget can implement these ideas.
- **Reference Properly**: Cite sources using a consistent format (e.g., APA, MLA).
