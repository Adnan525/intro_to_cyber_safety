# Introduction to Cyber Safety - Week 9: Cybercrime

## Discussion 1: Preventing Identity Theft

Identity theft involves stealing someone's identity and using their information fraudulently. To prevent identity theft, individuals should:

1. **Control personal information carefully** - Limit what is shared online, especially sensitive details like full name, date of birth, address, and government ID numbers.

2. **Secure social media accounts** - Set privacy settings to "private" and only share content with known and trusted connections. Avoid accepting friend requests from strangers.

3. **Be vigilant with documentation** - Properly dispose of documents containing personal information by shredding them rather than simply throwing them away.

4. **Monitor financial statements regularly** - Check bank and credit card statements frequently to spot unauthorized transactions early.

5. **Use strong, unique passwords** - Create complex passwords for different accounts and consider using a password manager.

6. **Be skeptical of communication requests** - Verify the legitimacy of emails or messages requesting personal information. Type official website addresses manually rather than clicking links in messages.

7. **Enable multi-factor authentication** - Add an extra layer of security beyond passwords for important accounts.

8. **Be careful when shopping online** - Only enter personal details on secure, legitimate websites.

9. **Check credit reports** - Regularly review credit reports to identify suspicious activities or accounts opened without permission.

10. **Be aware of warning signs** - Watch for unexpected bills, missing mail, denied credit for unknown reasons, or contacts from debt collectors about unfamiliar accounts.

## Discussion 2: Example of Accidental Data Loss

The accidental Southern New Hampshire University data breach (December 2015) is mentioned in the week 7 slides. This incident involved a configuration error that resulted in approximately 140,000 records being exposed publicly.

This type of accidental data breach can be avoided through:

1. **Proper configuration management** - Implement rigorous change management processes for system configurations.

2. **Regular security audits** - Conduct periodic reviews of system configurations and database access controls.

3. **Principle of least privilege** - Ensure employees only have access to data necessary for their jobs.

4. **Employee training** - Educate staff about secure data handling practices and potential risks.

5. **Automated security scanning** - Deploy tools that can identify misconfigurations or insecure database access settings.

6. **Data loss prevention tools** - Implement systems that can detect and prevent unauthorized data exposure.

7. **Documented procedures** - Create clear protocols for database configuration changes with multiple approval levels.

## Discussion 3: Importance of Preventing Cyber Abuse

Preventing cyber abuse is critically important for several reasons:

1. **Psychological well-being** - Cyber abuse can severely impact victims' mental health, causing anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. Prevention protects psychological health.

2. **Community safety** - A safe online environment enhances trust and confidence, contributing to a stable and productive digital community.

3. **Personal safety** - Online abuse can escalate to real-world harassment or violence in some cases.

4. **Social inclusion** - Victims of cyber abuse often withdraw from online spaces, leading to social isolation and lost opportunities for connection.

5. **Preservation of digital rights** - Everyone deserves to participate in digital spaces without fear of abuse or harassment.

6. **Educational and professional impacts** - Cyber abuse can disrupt victims' education or professional lives when they need to disengage from digital platforms.

7. **Legal implications** - Cyber abuse has been recognized in legislation, with specific laws now addressing various forms like image-based abuse, cyberstalking, and online threats.

8. **Protection of vulnerable populations** - Certain groups may be disproportionately targeted for cyber abuse, making prevention critical for equitable digital participation.

9. **Building digital citizenship** - Prevention efforts promote responsible and respectful online behavior, contributing to healthier digital communities.

10. **Reducing societal costs** - Cyber abuse has broader societal costs in terms of mental healthcare, lost productivity, and law enforcement resources.
