# Introduction to Cyber Safety - Week 10: Social media and protecting your reputation.

## Discussion 1: Securing Social Media Accounts

### Essential Actions to Secure Social Media Accounts

**Authentication & Access Control:**
- Implement strong, unique passwords for each social media account
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever available
- Use a password manager to maintain different complex passwords
- Regularly update passwords (every 3-6 months)
- Set up trusted contacts/recovery options for account lockouts
- Avoid accessing accounts on public computers or unsecured Wi-Fi networks

**Privacy Settings Configuration:**
- Review and adjust privacy settings for each platform:
  - For Facebook: Check Security and Login, Privacy Settings, Timeline and Tagging
  - For Twitter: Configure photo tagging, tweet privacy, location settings
  - For YouTube: Configure comment moderation, content visibility settings
- Control who can see your posts (friends, followers, public)
- Limit the visibility of personal information in your profile
- Disable location tagging/geotagging on posts
- Manage tagging permissions (review tags before they appear)
- Audit third-party app permissions regularly and revoke unnecessary access

**Content Management:**
- Be mindful of what you share - avoid posting sensitive or embarrassing information
- Don't post vacation plans or expensive purchases that might attract criminals
- Review what others post about you, including photo tags
- Organize friend lists/connections (close friends, acquaintances, restricted)
- Monitor your activity logs regularly for suspicious actions

**When Something Goes Wrong:**
- Don't respond to abuse or harassment
- Report abuse to the platform immediately
- Block abusive users
- Tell a trusted friend for support
- Report fake accounts impersonating you
- For compromised accounts:
  - Change passwords immediately
  - Check for unauthorized changes
  - Review connected applications
  - Report the breach to the platform
  - Scan devices for malware if account was hacked

**Ongoing Vigilance:**
- Be wary of suspicious messages, links, surveys or competitions
- Review connected apps regularly
- Stay informed about platform privacy policy changes
- Regularly audit your online presence

## Discussion 2: Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

| PII Criteria | Available/Not available | Risks involved |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Full name | Available | Identity theft, impersonation |
| Home address | Not directly available, but potential inference from geotagged posts | Stalking, physical threats, home invasion |
| Phone number | Not available publicly | Unwanted contact, harassment, SIM swapping |
| Date of birth | Available (shares birthday celebrations) | Identity theft, password recovery exploitation |
| Email address | Available (listed on professional profiles) | Phishing attempts, account takeovers, spam |
| Employment history | Available (on LinkedIn/professional sites) | Social engineering, targeted phishing |
| Family information | Available (tagged in family photos) | Social engineering, targeting family members |
| Geotagged content | Available (frequent location check-ins) | Stalking, determining patterns of movement, home location |
| Photos | Abundant | Facial recognition, deepfakes, unauthorized use |
| Political views | Available (through posts/liked content) | Targeted manipulation, discrimination |
| Travel patterns | Available (vacation posts) | Home robbery during absences, stalking |
| Financial indicators | Partially available (lifestyle posts) | Targeting for scams, theft |

## Discussion 3: Digital Persistence of "Deleted" Information

### Understanding Digital Persistence

When we "delete" digital information, it often remains accessible in various ways:

**Device-Level Persistence:**
- Deletion typically removes file pointers, not actual data
- Data remains on storage media until overwritten
- Even "permanently deleted" files can be recovered using forensic tools
- Deleted files in recycle bin/trash can be easily restored
- Operating systems maintain temporary files, caches, and logs
- File fragments can persist in unallocated disk space

**Internet/Cloud Persistence:**
- Social media platforms may retain deleted content on their servers
- Content may be archived by third-party services
- Search engines cache web content
- Internet archives (like Wayback Machine) retain historical snapshots
- Shared content may have been downloaded, screenshot, or reshared by others
- Metadata (including location data, timestamps) often persists separately
- Backup systems may retain deleted content for extended periods

**Precautions Before Posting Online:**

1. **Think Twice, Post Once** - Consider if you'd be comfortable seeing the content on a billboard

2. **Content Assessment:**
   - Is this something I'd want potential employers to see?
   - Could this information be used against me?
   - Could this reveal sensitive personal details?
   - Would I be comfortable with this content being permanent?

3. **Privacy Protection:**
   - Understand platform privacy settings before posting
   - Use appropriate audience controls (public vs. private)
   - Disable location data when unnecessary
   - Review tagged photos before they appear on your profile
   - Be cautious about revealing personal details (address, workplace, vacation plans)

4. **Digital Cleanup Practices:**
   - Use secure deletion tools for sensitive files
   - Regularly clear browser caches and history
   - Review and delete old social media posts periodically
   - Request data deletion from services you no longer use
   - Use privacy-focused tools when necessary (VPNs, private browsing)

5. **Legal Considerations:**
   - Understand that deleted content might be recoverable through legal processes
   - Be aware of platform data retention policies
   - Know that employment, legal, or relationship consequences can arise from deleted content

The fundamental principle remains: assume anything posted online could potentially become permanent and visible to anyone, regardless of deletion. Digital content should be treated as potentially permanent unless specifically secured with encryption or secure deletion methods.
